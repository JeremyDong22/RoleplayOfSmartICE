# Manual Test Guide for Task Card Swipe Functionality

## Test Cases

### 1. Basic Swipe Navigation
- **Test**: Swipe left/right on task cards
- **Expected**: Cards should transition smoothly between tasks
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Added proper boundary checks

### 2. First Task Boundary
- **Test**: Try to swipe right on the first task
- **Expected**: Should see elastic resistance (30% of swipe distance) and bounce back
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Added elastic resistance calculation

### 3. Last Task Boundary  
- **Test**: Try to swipe left on the last task
- **Expected**: Should see elastic resistance (30% of swipe distance) and bounce back
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Added elastic resistance calculation

### 4. Swipe Threshold
- **Test**: Make small swipes (less than 1/3 of container width)
- **Expected**: Card should snap back to current position
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Threshold logic intact

### 5. Dot Navigation
- **Test**: Click on dots below cards
- **Expected**: Should jump directly to that task
- **Status**: ✅ Working - Click handler implemented

### 6. Mouse Drag Support
- **Test**: Use mouse to drag cards (desktop)
- **Expected**: Same behavior as touch swipe
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed - Mouse events have same boundary logic

## Fixed Issues
1. ✅ Removed blank area when swiping beyond boundaries
2. ✅ Added elastic resistance at first/last task
3. ✅ Fixed transform calculation to use percentage-based offsets
4. ✅ Proper boundary detection prevents invalid activeTaskIndex
5. ✅ Fixed missing alpha import
6. ✅ Removed unused variables (currentTask, calculateProgress)

## Implementation Details
- Transform calculation now converts pixel offsets to percentages
- Elastic resistance factor: 0.3 (30% of actual swipe distance)
- Swipe threshold: 1/3 of container width
- Animation: 0.3s ease transition when not actively swiping
